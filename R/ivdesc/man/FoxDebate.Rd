\description{
The data set (n=507) contains findings from the experiment described in Albertson and Lawrence (2009) 
in which a representative sample of survey respondents in Orange County, California, were randomly
assigned to receive encouragement to view a Fox debate on affirmative action, which would take
place on the eve of the 1996 presidential election. Shortly after the election, these respondents were
reinterviewed. The postelection questionnaire asked respondents whether they viewed the debate,
whether they supported a California proposition (209) to eliminate affirmative action (\code{support}), 
and how informed they felt about the proposition (\code{infopro}). The dataset can be used to reproduce 
Table 2 in Aronow and Carnegie (2013). Note that mean imputation was used to handle missing data so 
non-integer values are imputed. \code{support} and \code{infopro} are excepted and include missing values.
