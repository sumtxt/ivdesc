### Install R Package 

You can install the package directly from CRAN: 

```R
install.packages("ivdesc")
```

Or install the latest version from Github using:  

```R
devtools::install_github("sumtxt/ivdesc/R/ivdesc")
```

You may need to install the `devtools` package first. 


### Install STATA Package

To install the STATA package directly from Github use:

```STATA
github install sumtxt/ivdesc
```

This will only work if you installed the [GITHUB module](https://github.com/haghish/github) via `net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")` first.
